If you have ever done site mockups in Photoshop and needed to mark these with pixel measurements you know what an incredibly tedious task this can be.

I went looking for a script that would help you automatize this process. Surprised to not find one, I decided to write one myself.

# Installation #

  * Download the latest version, unzip and place the Pixel Measure.jsx file in your Photoshop scripts directory (located in <your photoshop program directory>/Presets/Scripts).

  * Restart Photoshop.

  * The Pixel Measure script should now be visible in the File > Scripts menu. For ease of use you might want to create a keyboard shortcut to the script. This can be done through the Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts menu.

# Usage #

  * Make a selection in a document and run the script.

  * To create a horizontal measurement - select an area that has a greater width than height, and vice versa.

  * The color of the measurement is determined by your current foreground color.

  * The line thickness of the measurement is determined by your current pencil settings.
