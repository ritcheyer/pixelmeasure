If you have ever done site mockups in Photoshop and needed to mark these with pixel measurements you know what an incredibly tedious task this can be.

I went looking for a script that would help you automatize this process. Surprised to not find one, I decided to write one myself.

## Installation
* [Download the latest version](https://code.google.com/p/pixelmeasure/downloads/list), unzip and place the Pixel Measure.jsx file in your Photoshop scripts directory (located in `<your photoshop program directory>/Presets/Scripts`).
* Restart Photoshop.
* The Pixel Measure script should now be visible in the File > Scripts menu. For ease of use you might want to create a keyboard shortcut to the script. This can be done through the Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts menu.

## Usage
1. Make a selection in a document and run the script.
2. To create a horizontal measurement - select an area that has a greater width than height, and vice versa.
3. The color of the measurement is determined by your current foreground color.
4. The line thickness of the measurement is determined by your current pencil settings.
